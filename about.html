        <p class="about-text">
          Hi there! My name is Myra, and I live in Ringle, Wisconsin. I've always had a love for creating things with my hands and collecting the bits and pieces that tell stories from the past. What started as a personal hobbyâ€”making gifts for friends, gathering old paper, and sewing late into the night, slowly blossomed into something more.
        </p>
        <p class="about-text">
          This shop is a reflection of the things I treasure: meaningful details, forgotten treasures, and handmade items that serve a purpose while bringing a little beauty into the everyday. I find joy in turning fabric scraps into something useful, bundling vintage papers for journaling, and curating collections of ephemera that might otherwise be lost to time.
        </p>
        <p class="about-text">
          My handmade items like bowl cozies, clothespin bags, and zipper pouches are sewn with care and practicality in mind. I make things I actually use in my own home, and I love sharing them with others who appreciate both function and charm. Each piece is unique, and no two are ever quite the same.
        </p>
        <p class="about-text">
          On the vintage side, I spend hours at estate sales, antique shops, and thrift stores searching for old music sheets, postcards, books, buttons, and sewing patterns. Every item I find feels like a little piece of history worth passing on. I bundle these treasures so crafters, scrapbookers, and collectors can use them to create new stories of their own.
        </p>
        <p class="about-text">
          Thank you so much for supporting this little shop. Every order truly makes my day, and I'm so grateful to be able to share what I love with others. If you ever have questions, custom requests, or just want to say hello, I'd love to hear from you.
